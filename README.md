## Overview:
<ol>
<li>During this pandemic time, people are spending time with their families at their homes taking utmost precautions. We want to build an application which not only gives fun and entertainment for the family but also spreads awareness about the Corona Virus and ways for its prevention. </li>
<li>As we know currently, the best weapon we have against this deadly Virus is Social distancing and the best way to achieve this is Staying at Home. As a result, all countries have announced a complete lockdown. </li>
</ol>

## Process Flow:
<ul>
<li>That is why we came up with the idea to develop a Fun mobile game, that we call “Stop the Spread”</li>
<li>This game gives you your own cartoon city with Apartments, cars, buses, airports, shopping malls, hospitals, parks, restaurants etc with busy people having daily hustles, very similar to what we have normally.</li>
<li>As soon as the game starts, the city starts getting infected with by the corona virus. Your task is to Quarantine certain public areas and apartments in order to minimize the risk of the outbreak for the people of this city.</li> 
<li>But beware the quarantined areas also become free after sometime as people can’t stay in isolation without resources for long periods of time. </li>
<li>Considering all the constraints your job is to keep the death rate of your city as low as possible and keep the citizens of this city safe and happy.</li>
</ul>
  
## Our Progress

### 1. Pitcher 1:
* Designed and developed the city.
* Implemented AR-based ground tracking and anchoring for the city. 
### 2. Pitcher 2:
* Based on the suggestions from the mentors we first implemented a 3D map of a real-world place in our Unity project.
* Implemented Mapbox SDK for Unity in order to develop city based on user's selected location.
### 3. Pitcher 3:
* Completed the random movement of citizens from home to public places and vice versa.

* Implemented the Markov's probabilistic model to determine the state of the user i.e. susceptible, infected or dead.
* Developed a script to ensure the citizens stay indoors during quarantine.
* Added a Scoreboard to keep a track of the healthy, infected, and dead citizens.
* Implemented the entire backend logic for the working prototype.

## Future Scope
* Adding multiplayer features to increase competitive feeling.
* Making the application more realistic by adding real-life scenarios.
